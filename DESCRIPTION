Description: This is a simple package that fits the logistic equation to 
    microbial growth curve data (e.g., repeated absorbance measurements 
    taken from a plate reader over time). From this fit, a variety of 
    "fitness" proxies are provided, including the maximum growth rate, 
    the doubling time, the carrying capacity, the area under the logistic 
    curve, and the time to the inflection point.
